Three different layers to backend:
1. Routers      ::: Receptionist
2. Controllers  ::: Waiter
3. Models       ::: Cook

Steps to make project:
1. Create Node.js project [Create parent folder => npm init => name, description, keep index.js, etc]
2. Define the structure [creating folders, i.e. routers, controllers and models]
3. Authetication on user: two types: Admin and customer. 
(a) Registration (b) Login => accesstoken JWT (for expiry time)
Thus, dependencies needed are (i) Mongoose, (ii) Express, (iii) json web token, (iv) bcryptjs (for password)

[install all packages : npm install bcryptjs express jsonwebtoken mongoose]
4. model => controller => routers
